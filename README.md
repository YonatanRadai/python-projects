# Python Learning Projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects designed to support a gradual learning path — from beginner exercises to advanced, production-ready applications.

## What's Inside

- **Progressive learning** — Projects increase in complexity, covering both foundational skills and advanced patterns.
- **Real-world focus** — Each project solves a concrete problem or simulates a real application scenario.
- **Best practices** — Clean code, modular design, and version control in every project.
- **Open architecture** — Each project lives in its own directory with its own README and structure.
