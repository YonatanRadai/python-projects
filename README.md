# Python Learning Projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects designed to support a gradual learning path — from beginner exercises to advanced, production-ready applications.

## What's Inside

- **Progressive learning** — Projects increase in complexity, covering both foundational skills and advanced patterns.
- **Real-world focus** — Each project solves a concrete problem or simulates a real application scenario.

## Who Is This For?

- Python learners looking for real, hands-on projects
- Developers seeking reference implementations for common tasks
- Anyone building a project portfolio

## Topics Covered (Growing List)

**Beginner**
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Functions and parameters  
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples  
- File input/output (reading/writing files)  
- Error handling and debugging (try/except)  
- Basic modules and importing

**Intermediate**
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)  
- Working with external libraries (e.g. `pygame`, `requests`)  
- Modules and packages  
- Virtual environments and `requirements.txt`  
- Decorators and higher-order functions  
- Working with JSON, CSV and APIs  
- Simple GUI applications  
- Unit testing and test-driven development  
- Using Git and GitHub effectively

**Advanced**
- Design patterns in Python  
- Advanced OOP (composition, polymorphism, magic methods)  
- Generators, iterators and comprehensions  
- Functional programming (lambda, map/filter/reduce)  
- Concurrency: multithreading & multiprocessing  
- Creating and using custom Python packages  
- Performance profiling and optimization  
- Writing clean, scalable and maintainable code  
- Deployment techniques and Docker for Python apps
